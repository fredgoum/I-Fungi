SAUTDELINE

**MORPHOLOGY**

On malt-agar medium, the mycelium (1) with a regular form appears flush,
velvety appearance, olive-brown color, due to sporulation abundant in the open air. Conidiophores produce chains from 10 to 15 conidies. There is no described sexual form.

Conidia are brown, multicellular and present essentially transverse partitions. The conidia at the end of the chain are always smaller than those of the base.

SAUTDELINE

**ECOLOGY**

*A. brassicicola* is a necrotropic fungus that is part of a complex of pathogenic species of Brassicaceae exclusively. The disease of the "black spot" touches the whole of the aerial organs and is reflected in the development of
necroses sometimes surrounded by a yellow halo. (3 on sheets, 4 on
siliqua). It can be preserved at the level of crop residues or
seed and be transmitted to the seedling. Lacking deficiencies and
Sowing fonts are also associated symptoms.
